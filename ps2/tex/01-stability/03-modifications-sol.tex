\begin{answer}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item No, because the dateset is still linearly sepatable.
        \item Yes, when t is big enough, $||\theta_{prev} - \theta||$ will finally less 
        equal than the threshould, i.e. 1e-15 and terminate the loop.
        \item No, the dateset is still linearly separable.
        \item Yes, it prevent $\theta$ from getting infinitely bigger.
        \item Yes, it can make the dataset not linearly separable.
      \end{enumerate}
